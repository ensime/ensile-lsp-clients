# ensime-lsp-clients
Collection of clients for ENSIME LSP implementation

Currently supported editors:
- vs-code (`ensime-lsp-vscode` folder)
- atom (`ensime-lsp-atom` folder)

[__NOT ACTIVE__]

_This project was an attempt to show how to reuse logic around ENSIME written in Scala.js for both vscode and atom. But now I have no time and motivation to continue, since I personally don't use vscode or atom for development and ENSIME project is becoming unstable, unfortunately_ 

_See https://github.com/ensime/ensime-lsp-clients/issues/1 for basic instructions of how to build and run the project_
